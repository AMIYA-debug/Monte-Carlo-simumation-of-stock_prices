 üìùA Short History~

Monte Carlo simulations were born out of a card game.In the 1940s, physicist Stanislaw Ulam, while recovering from illness, wondered if he could estimate his chances of winning solitaire just by simulating it thousands of times. This sparked the idea of using randomness to solve complex problems.

He teamed up with John von Neumann, and they used the method to simulate nuclear reactions during the Manhattan Project. The name "Monte Carlo" was inspired by Ulam‚Äôs uncle, who loved gambling at the Monte Carlo Casino fitting for a method all about chance.

Today, Monte Carlo is everywhere from finance and engineering to AI and climate modeling. It all started with a simple question and a deck of cards.
