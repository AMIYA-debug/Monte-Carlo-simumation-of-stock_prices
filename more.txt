This project simulates future stock prices using the Monte Carlo method and Object-Oriented Programming in C++. It’s based on a financial model that assumes stock prices evolve over time with some average growth and random fluctuations. By generating many possible price paths, the simulation helps visualize how a stock might behave under uncertain market conditions. It’s a great way to learn both C++ OOP and core concepts used in quantitative finance, like randomness, volatility, and simulation-based forecasting
